# ML Engineering Portfolio

A comprehensive collection of machine learning projects, experiments, and foundational tutorials covering the full spectrum of AI engineering - from basic concepts to production-ready systems.

## 🏗 Portfolio Structure

### 🎯 Foundations
[Core concepts and official framework tutorials](./foundations/README.md) that form the bedrock of my ML knowledge.

- [**`foundations/pytorch-coding-challenges/`**](./foundations/pytorch-coding-challenges/README.md) - Hands-on problem solving for PyTorch interview & production readiness
- [**`foundations/amazon-bedrock-workshop/`**](./foundations/amazon-bedrock-workshop/README.md) - Building production AI applications with AWS Bedrock foundation models
- [**`foundations/pytorch-official-tutorials/`**](./foundations/pytorch-official-tutorials/README.md) - PyTorch fundamentals and workflow
- [**`foundations/tensorflow-official-tutorials/`**](./foundations/tensorflow-official-tutorials/README.md) - TensorFlow certification and production ML practices
- [**`foundations/yandex_handbook_rus/`**](./foundations/yandex_handbook_rus/README.md)  - Classical ML theory & practice (regression, metrics, CV, pipelines)
