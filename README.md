# ML Engineering Portfolio

A comprehensive collection of machine learning projects, experiments, and foundational tutorials covering the full spectrum of AI engineering - from basic concepts to production-ready systems.

## 🏗 Portfolio Structure

### 🎯 Foundations
[Core concepts and official framework tutorials](./foundations/README.md) that form the bedrock of my ML knowledge.

- [**`foundations/pytorch-official-tutorials/`**](./foundations/pytorch-official-tutorials/README.md) - PyTorch fundamentals and workflow
- [**`foundations/tensorflow-official-tutorials/`**](./foundations/tensorflow-official-tutorials/README.md) - TensorFlow certification and production ML practices

### 🚧 In Progress
- **Projects** - End-to-end ML systems (coming soon)
- **Experiments** - Research prototypes and advanced techniques (coming soon)  
- **Tools & Techniques** - MLOps and engineering practices (coming soon)

**Next Focus Areas**: DSPy, LLM-as-a-judge, LLM fine-tuning, Multi-agent systems

## 🛠 Technical Stack

**Frameworks**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras  
**Domains**: NLP, Time Series, Distributed Training, Computer Vision  
**Tools**: Google Colab, Jupyter, Git

## 🎓 Learning Philosophy

This portfolio represents my hands-on approach to mastering machine learning engineering:
- Start with official documentation and tutorials
- Understand fundamental concepts deeply  
- Build progressively complex projects
- Focus on production-ready practices

## 📈 Progress Tracking

- **✅ Completed**: Core framework tutorials (PyTorch + TensorFlow)
- **🔄 In Progress**: Reconfiguring private projects and research for public release
- **📋 Planned**: DSPy projects, LLM fine-tuning, RAG applying, LLM-as-a-judge frameworks
