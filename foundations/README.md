# Foundations

This section contains my journey through the core concepts and official tutorials of major machine learning frameworks. Each subdirectory represents a structured learning path with practical implementations.

## ðŸ“š Learning Tracks

### PyTorch
**Location**: `pytorch-official-tutorials/`  
**Focus**: Deep learning fundamentals, autograd, training loops, model management  
**Status**: âœ… Complete beginner series  
**Key Skills**: Tensor operations, custom datasets, neural network architecture, optimization

### TensorFlow  
**Location**: `tensorflow-official-tutorials/`  
**Focus**: Production-ready ML, distributed training, hyperparameter tuning, multiple domains  
**Status**: âœ… Comprehensive framework coverage  
**Key Skills**: Distributed training, model persistence, TensorBoard, Keras Tuner, multi-domain applications

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

- Master framework-specific APIs and best practices
- Understand the complete ML workflow from data to deployment
- Build intuition for model architecture and optimization
- Develop reproducible experimentation habits

## ðŸ”„ Progression

These foundations directly support the projects in the main portfolio, providing the building blocks for more complex systems.
