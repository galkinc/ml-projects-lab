        "     - Computes attention scores via the dot product of query and key vectors.\n",

        "\n",
        "### Self-Attention\n",
        "- Keys, queries, and values all come from the same source sequence\n",
        "- Allows each position to attend to all positions in the sequence\n",
        "\n",
        "### Cross-Attention\n",
        "- The queries come from one sequence (e.g., the decoder in a seq2seq model), while the keys and values come from another (e.g., the encoder).\n",
        "- Often used in machine translation and generative tasks where one sequence attends to another.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Multi-Head Attention\n",
        "- Runs multiple attention mechanisms in parallel\n",
        "- Allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions. Each head can potentially learn to focus on different types of relationships or features.\n",
        "\n",
        "### MultiQuery Attention (MQA)\n",
        "- All query heads share the same key and value matrices, only query matrices are different\n",
        "- Significantly reduces memory requirements and inference time\n",
        "- Can lead to quality degradation compared to MHA\n",
        "\n",
        "### Grouped-Query Attention (GQA)\n",
        "- Introduced to balance the efficiency of MQA and the quality in MHA\n",
        "- In MHA, each query head has its own key-value heads (maximum quality but high memory usage). In MQA, all query heads share just one key-value head (maximum efficiency but lower quality). GQA divides query heads into groups, where each group shares a set of key-value heads.\n",
        "- The number of groups (G) is a hyperparameter - more groups is closer to MHA, fewer is closer to MQA\n",
        "- Used in models like Llama 2-70B, Mistral 7B, and Falcon 40B. Particularly useful in multi-GPU environments with tensor parallelism\n",
        "\n",
        "### Global vs. Local Attention\n",
        "- Global Attention attends to all positions in the sequence (standard approach). It helps maintain long-range dependencies that local attention might miss.\n",
        "- Local Attention attends only to a window of positions around the current position. It reduces computational complexity from O(n²) to O(n).\n",
        "- Architectures like Longformer and BigBird use hybrid approaches combining both: local attention for most tokens, augmented with some form of global attention (specific tokens attending globally, or sparse global attention patterns) to retain the ability to capture long-range dependencies where needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Multi-token attention\n",
        "- Addresses limitations of single-token attention where individual weights are determined by similarity of just one query-key pair\n",
        "- Applies convolution operations over queries, keys, and heads to allow neighboring tokens to influence each other's attention weights"
