# Foundations

PyTorch practice problems, ranging from basic to hard, designed to enhance skills in deep learning and PyTorch.

The tasks were taken from: [TorchLeet / easy](https://github.com/Exorust/TorchLeet/tree/main/torch/easy) and [basic](https://github.com/Exorust/TorchLeet/tree/main/torch/basic)
The goal is not just to solve, but to **understand**, **explain** and **prepare for live-coding**. 

## 📚 Question Set
