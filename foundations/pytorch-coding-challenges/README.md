# Foundations

PyTorch practice problems, ranging from basic to hard, designed to enhance skills in deep learning and PyTorch.

The tasks were taken from: [TorchLeet / easy](https://github.com/Exorust/TorchLeet/tree/main/torch/easy) and [basic](https://github.com/Exorust/TorchLeet/tree/main/torch/basic)
The goal is not just to solve, but to **understand**, **explain** and **prepare for live-coding**. 

## 📚 Question Set

### [Medium](./medium_tasks/)
For practitioners looking to deepen their understanding of advanced concepts.
- [Implement Custom CNN layers: Conv2dCustom and MaxPool2dCustom from scratch)](./medium_tasks/custom_cnn_layers_from_scratch.ipynb).
- [Implement parameter initialization for a CNN (Compare zero, random, Xavier and Kaiming)](./medium_tasks/implement_parameter_initialization_for_cnn.ipynb).

### [Easy](./easy_tasks/easy_tasks.ipynb)
Recommended for those who have a basic understanding of PyTorch and want to practice their skills.
